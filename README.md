To contributors: Please help me fill this out with accurate data.

## Ethos:

"In the real world, you would never ask someone to sign a contract that they cant read. " - @phil_uplc twitter

"This culture of making excuses for "decentralized" applications with closed-source smart contracts needs to stop.
**Your application is not a DApp if your smart contracts cannot be independently reviewed** by the public for backdoors / master-keys. " - @phil_uplc twitter

"All closed source code can have some backdoors to steal your funds" - @notjuve twitter


### Dishonourable Mentions:
| Name | Logo | Why |
|--|--|----------|
| *Liqwid Finance* | ![](https://liqwid.finance/images/icon/logo.svg) | advertises as "DeFi" (decentralised finance) despite not open-sourcing their main protocol contracts. |
| *VyFi* | ![](https://app.vyfi.io/images/vyfi-blank-logo.png) | to my knowledge operates as DeX but has not open-sourced ther main contracts. |
| *Optim Finance* | ![](https://www.optim.finance/assets/optim.svg) | calls itself "decentralization advocates" despite not open-sourcing their main protocol contracts. |
| *WingRiders* | ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1612367031457792002/e4UOYgqb_400x400.png) | are probably the biggest scumbags on Cardano. Also closed source "DeX". |
| *SundaeSwap* | ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1573111846579617794/jftnVq8h_400x400.jpg) |  says they build "decentralized software" however do not meet the most basic tenant of decentralisation, making their main protocol smart contracts open-source.

note: Sundae & Liqwid Labs both make significant OS contributions however it is a smudge against them that they do not open-source their protocol smart contracts.

### Some honourable mentions:
- *Indigo* is a fully-fledged protocol, and one of the largest which is also completely open-source.
- *LenFi* v1 has been open-source and has already open-sourced v2 before launch.
- *Spectrum-Finance* (soon to be splash) is probably the only DeX which is actually decentralised.
- *Danogo* is a cool project, would like to see more bonds some day.
