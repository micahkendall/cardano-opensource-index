To contributors: Please help me fill this out with accurate data.

## Ethos:

"In the real world, you would never ask someone to sign a contract that they cant read. " - @phil_uplc twitter

"This culture of making excuses for "decentralized" applications with closed-source smart contracts needs to stop.
**Your application is not a DApp if your smart contracts cannot be independently reviewed** by the public for backdoors / master-keys. " - @phil_uplc twitter

"All closed source code can have some backdoors to steal your funds" - @notjuve twitter

note: Sundae & Liqwid Labs both make significant OS contributions however it is a smudge against them that they do not open-source their protocol smart contracts.

### Some honourable mentions:

- _Indigo_ is a fully-fledged protocol, and one of the largest which is also completely open-source.
- _LenFi_ v1 has been open-source and has already open-sourced v2 before launch.
- _Spectrum-Finance_ (soon to be splash) is probably the only DeX which is actually decentralised.
- _Danogo_ is a cool project, would like to see more bonds some day.
